<h1>Typescript test project</h1>
<h3>Course creator</h3>

This project is a part of the Udemy "Understanding Typescript" course and is a basic interface to create courses and manage the status 
of the course with a drag & drop function. 

The Idea was to implement typescript functionalities such as Typecasting, inheritance, implement, decorators, extends, interfaces, abstract,
to mention some of them, fell fre to checkout the code, most of it has comments to describe the functionality of the code.
